## A bare bones wordpress starter template

Created for theme development, not as an out of the box theme. Contains the basic scaffold to get a wordpress theme up and running quickly. Use it to boostrap your new wordpress theme and builld upon it to create your amazing themes. This is my current preferred starting point but is always evolving as I develop more. 

### Prerequisites
Assumes the use of:
* SASS 
* Wordpress (duh)
* Advanced Custom Fields - http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/
