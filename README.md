## A bare bones wordpress starter template

Created for theme development, not as an out of the box theme. This project contains very basic scaffolds, style templates and Common Wordpress functions to get a bare bones theme up and running quickly. Use it to boostrap your new wordpress theme and and then builld upon it to create your amazing themes. Built with flexibility in mind so you can go crazy.

### Prerequisites
Assumes the use of:
* SASS - http://sass-lang.com/
* Wordpress (duh)
* Advanced Custom Fields - http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/

### Any improvements?
If you have stumbled accross this and have any suggestions or improvements you would like to share, I'm all ears. This is simply a starter template I have developed over time to save some time, and is the product of many iterations of many projects so the chances are there I things that can be done better.
